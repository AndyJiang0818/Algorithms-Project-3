# AVL Trees

## Overview

## Thoughts
Set up a constructor sequence_map. 
Created public operations "bool operator", "friend ostream& operator", "void Merge"; 
and private "string recognition_sequence_", "vector<string> enzyme_acronyms_". 
Threw an "UnderflowException" when there is an error. 
Completed the method where removing x from the tree, and nothing happens when x is not found. 
Print out the tree properly. 

## Run
- To compile on terminal type:
1. make clean
2. make all

- To delete executables and object file type:
1. make clean
